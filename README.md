## Project overview

This repository contains my solutions to all Java exercises from the **Digital Nurture 4.0 — CTS** course/module. Each exercise is implemented and tested by me individually.
The goal of these exercises was to practice Java fundamentals, object-oriented programming, and common algorithmic patterns git plsql and microservices.

## Notes on correctness & testing
I implemented and manually tested all exercises. Where appropriate, small input/output samples and basic unit tests are included in the exercise folders.

If you find an issue, please open an issue in the repository and describe the problem.

## Declaration of authenticity
I hereby declare that the solutions in this repository were implemented entirely by me without unauthorized assistance.
Any code, algorithm, or snippet taken from external sources is explicitly credited in the corresponding exercise README.md and/or comments.

## Contribution
This repository is a personal record of my work on the Digital Nurture 4.0 CTS Java exercises. Contributions are not expected. 
If you want to suggest improvements, open an issue or send a pull request; please include a clear explanation and tests where relevant.
